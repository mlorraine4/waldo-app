# Where's Waldo Remix (Photo Tagging App)


# Summary
This is my project submission for The Odin Project's [Where's Waldo assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app-javascript
). For this project, I worked with a backend database service for the first time. This is my fourth project created using ReactJS. I used Firebase firestore to store player's scores, as well as each character's image coordinates.
